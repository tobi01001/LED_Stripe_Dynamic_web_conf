# Multi-Page Web Interface Enhancement

This enhancement addresses issue #23 by implementing a structured multi-page web interface to replace the single-page design, making the LED control application more organized and user-friendly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Structure
- Added responsive navigation bar with 4 main sections:
  - **Main Controls**: Basic LED strip control (power, brightness, segments, mirroring)
  - **Effects & Patterns**: Visual effects and color patterns (modes, palettes, colors, autoplay)
  - **Advanced Settings**: Technical settings (color correction, power limits, blur, reverse)
  - **System Info**: Status, network information, and system controls

### 2. Page-Specific Filtering
- Implemented JavaScript filtering logic that shows only relevant fields on each page
- Fields are categorized based on their purpose and usage patterns
- Maintains full functionality while reducing visual complexity

### 3. Server Routing
- Added new HTTP routes in `src/httpledstripe_esp.cpp`:
  - `/effects` → `effects.htm`
  - `/advanced` → `advanced.htm` 
  - `/system` → `system.htm`
- Root path `/` continues to serve the main controls page

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Each page has descriptive headers explaining its purpose
- Active navigation highlighting shows current page
- Consistent styling and layout across all pages
- Preserved all existing API endpoints and WebSocket functionality

## File Structure

```
data/
├── main.htm          # Main controls page (also served as index.htm)
├── effects.htm       # Effects and patterns page
├── advanced.htm      # Advanced settings page  
├── system.htm        # System information page
├── application.js    # Enhanced with page filtering logic
└── templates.htm     # Shared form templates
```

## Implementation Details

### Page Filtering Logic
The JavaScript application now includes a `pageFieldMapping` configuration that maps field names to appropriate pages:

- **Main**: `power`, `brightness`, `segments`, `mirrored`, `running`
- **Effects**: `effect`, `mode`, `palette`, `speed`, `color`, `autoplay`, `hue`
- **Advanced**: `temperature`, `correction`, `reverse`, `current`, `fps`, `blend`, `blur`
- **System**: `status`, `network`, `reset`, `version`, `uptime`, `memory`, `wifi`

### Backwards Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints remain unchanged
- WebSocket communication works across all pages
- Original functionality is preserved
- Users can still access all features, just in a more organized manner

## Testing
- Verified navigation between all pages works correctly
- Confirmed page-specific content filtering
- Tested responsive design on different screen sizes
- Validated that all JavaScript functionality is preserved

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience by organizing the interface into logical sections while maintaining full functionality and backwards compatibility.
